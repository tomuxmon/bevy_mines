# bevy_mines

This repository contains my personal implementation of the [Bevy Minesweeper](https://dev.to/qongzi/bevy-minesweeper-introduction-4l7f) tutorial series. If you are learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or you want to jump into [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game development it is a good pick.
